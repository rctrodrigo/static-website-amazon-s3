## Preface

The goal of this project is to build a static website to showcase my portfolio. This project uses
[HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) for the content and
structure of the document, [CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) for the
styles and animations, [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) for the behaviors and
logic of the website. Besides, it uses a simple storage service named [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) to host
the static website.
