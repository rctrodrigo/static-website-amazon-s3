## Preface 

Built a static website in **2019** when I was in college. This project uses 
[HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) for the content and 
structure of the document, [CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) for the 
styles and animations. This is **v0** (initial version) of my portfolio static website.
